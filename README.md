# Tic Tac Toe in C
A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe (X and O) game written in C. This game offers three different modes:

### Mode 1: Player vs. Player
In this mode, you and a friend can play against each other on the same computer, taking turns to place your moves on the grid.

### Mode 2: Player vs. Bot [Easy]
In this mode, you play against a bot that doesn't really know how to play the game, so it makes random moves.

### Mode 3: Player vs. Bot [Hard]
In this mode, you play against one of the best algorithms known as miniMax, and the chances of you winning are close to zero.
